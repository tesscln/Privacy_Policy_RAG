A decree in the Conseil d'Etat, taken after a reasoned and published opinion of the National Commission on Informatics and Freedom, concludes the categories of controllers and finalises them on the basis of which the latter can be implemented when they relate to data containing the number of persons registered in the national register for the identification of natural persons. The implementation of the treatments takes place without prejudice to the obligations incumbent upon the controllers or their subcontractors pursuant to Section 3 of Chapter IV of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016.

The first subparagraph of this Article does not apply to processing of personal data which includes the number of persons registered in the national register for the identification of natural persons or which requires a consultation of that register:

1 Who have exclusively public statistics finalities, are implemented by the public statistical service and do not include any of the data referred to in Article 6 or Article 46;

2 Who have exclusively scientific or historical research finalities;

3 The purpose of which is to make available to the users of the administration one or more of the services of the finished electronic administration Article 1 of Ordinance No 2005-1516 of 8 December 2005 on electronic exchange between users and administrative authorities within the meaning of Article 1 and between these administrative authorities.

The delegation provided for for the treatments referred to in the first and second paragraphs of this Article shall apply only if the number of registrations in the national register for the identification of natural persons is the subject of a cryptographic op ration replacing it with a non-significant statistical code.

In the case of the treatments referred to in paragraph 1, the use of the meaningless statistical code shall be permitted only within the public statistical service.

For the treatments which the finalisations are mentioned in 2 , the cryptographic op ration and, in the case of the case, the interconnection of two files by the use of the non-significant specific code resulting from it cannot be assured by the person or by the controller.

By derogating from the first subparagraph, personal data processing in the health field is governed by Section 3 of Chapter III of Title II, with the exception of:

1 Treatments referred to in Article 67;

2 Treatments containing the number of registrations in the national register for the identification of natural persons used as identifiers for the health of persons pursuant to Article L. 1111-8-1 of the Public Health Code, apart from those of those treatments implemented for the purposes of research or serving as databases for the subsequent research, study or evaluation purposes in the field of health .

Article 112
Order No 2018-1125 of 12 December 2018 - s. 1
The person responsible for processing personal data may not transfer data or authorize the transfer of data transmitted to a State not belonging to the European Union unless the following conditions are met:
1 The transfer of these data is necessary one of the finalit s nonc es in the first subparagraph of Article 87;
2 Personal data shall be transferred to an official established in that State which is not a member of the European Union or within an international organisation which is a competent authority responsible for the purposes of the first subparagraph of Article 87 in France;
3 If the personal data come from another State, the State which transmitted the data has already authorized this transfer in accordance with its national law.
However, if the prior authorisation cannot be obtained in good time, these personal data may be transmitted again without the prior authorisation of the State which transmitted these data where such further transmission is necessary to prevent a serious and imminent threat to the public security of another State or to safeguard the essential interests of France. The authorization from which these personal data came shall be informed without delay;
4 The European Commission has adopted an advisory decision pursuant to Article 36 of Directive (EU) 2016/680 of 27 April 2016 or, in the absence of such a decision, a legally binding instrument provides appropriate guarantees as regards the protection of personal data or, in the absence of such a decision and instrument, the controller has earned all the circumstances of the transfer and considers that such appropriate guarantees exist.
Appropriate guarantees provided by a binding legal instrument referred to in paragraph 4 may result either from guarantees relating to the protection of data referred to in the conventions implemented with that State which is not part of the European Union or from legally binding provisions requiring the occasion of the exchange of data.
Where the controller, other than a court carrying out a processing activity in the course of its judicial activities, transfers personal data solely on the basis of the existence of adequate guarantees with regard to the protection of personal data, he shall notify the National Commission on Informatics and Freedom of Transfer cat gories on that basis.
In this case, the controller must keep a record of the date and time of the transfer, of the information on the competent authority to which it is addressed, of the justification for the transfer and of the personal characteristics transferred.
Where the European Commission has repealed, amended or suspended a decision on the application of Article 36 of Directive (EU) 2016/680 of 27 April 2016, the controller may, however, transfer personal data or authorise the transfer of data transmitted to a State not belonging to the European Union if appropriate safeguards for the protection of personal data are provided in a legally binding instrument or if the controller considers, after having obtained all the circumstances of the transfer, that there are appropriate safeguards for the protection of personal data.

1 To safeguard the vital interests of the person concerned or of another person;
2 To safeguard the interests of the person concerned when provided for by the French law;
3 To prevent a serious and imminent threat to the public security of another State;
4 In particular cases, one of the conclusions of the first subparagraph of Article 87;
5 In a particular case, the finding, exercise or defence of legal rights in relation to my purposes.
In the cases mentioned in the 4 and 5 of this Article, the person responsible for processing personal data shall not transfer such data if he considers that the freedom and fundamental rights of the person concerned prevail over the public interest in the transfer envisaged.
Where a transfer is carried out for the purpose of safeguarding the interests of the person concerned, the controller shall keep a record of the date and time of the transfer, of the information on the competent authority to which it is addressed, of the justification for the transfer and of the personal characteristics transferred.

1 The transfer is necessary for the execution of the mission of the competent authority which transmits these data for one of the finalit es nonc es in the first subparagraph of Article 87;

4 The competent authority of the other State is informed in the best of terms, unless it is ineffective or inappropriate;
5 The competent authority which transmits these data shall inform the recipient of the finalit or finalit s for which the personal data transmitted must be processed exclusively by that recipient, provided that such processing is necessary.

The person responsible for processing personal data may not transfer data or authorize the transfer of data transmitted to a State not belonging to the European Union unless the following conditions are met:

1 The transfer of these data is necessary one of the finalit s nonc es in the first subparagraph of Article 70(1);

2 Personal data shall be transferred to an official established in that State which is not a member of the European Union or within an international organisation which is an authority responsible for the purposes of Article 70(1) in France;

3 If the personal data come from another State, the State which transmitted the data has already authorized this transfer in accordance with its national law.

However, if the prior authorisation cannot be obtained in good time, these personal data may be transmitted again without the prior authorisation of the State which transmitted these data where such further transmission is necessary to prevent a serious and imminent threat to the public security of another State or to safeguard the essential interests of France. The authorization from which these personal data came shall be informed without delay;

4 The European Commission has adopted an advisory decision pursuant to Article 36 of Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 or, in the absence of such a decision, a legally binding instrument provides adequate guarantees as regards the protection of personal data or, in the absence of such a decision and instrument, the controller has earned all the circumstances of the transfer and considers that such appropriate guarantees exist.

Appropriate guarantees provided by a binding legal instrument referred to in paragraph 4 may result either from guarantees relating to the protection of data referred to in the conventions implemented with that State which is not part of the European Union or from legally binding provisions requiring the occasion of the exchange of data.

Where the controller, other than a court carrying out a processing activity in the course of its judicial activities, transfers personal data solely on the basis of the existence of adequate guarantees with regard to the protection of personal data, he shall notify the National Commission on Informatics and Freedom of Transfer cat gories on that basis.

In this case, the controller must keep a record of the date and time of the transfer, of the information on the competent authority to which it is addressed, of the justification for the transfer and of the personal characteristics transferred.

Where the European Commission has repealed, amended or suspended a decision on the application adopted pursuant to Article 36 of Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 particular, the controller may, however, transfer personal data or authorise the transfer of data transmitted to a State not belonging to the European Union if appropriate guarantees with regard to the protection of personal data are provided in a legally binding instrument or if the controller considers, after having obtained all the circumstances of the transfer, that there are adequate guarantees with regard to the protection of personal data.

By way of derogation from Article 70-25, the person responsible for the processing of personal data may, in the absence of a decision on the application or of appropriate guarantees, transfer such data or authorise the transfer of data transmitted to a State not belonging to the European Union only where the transfer is necessary:

1 To safeguard the vital interests of the person concerned or of another person;

2 To safeguard the interests of the person concerned when provided for by the French law;

3 To prevent a serious and imminent threat to the public security of another State;

4 In particular cases, one of the finalis s nonc es in the first subparagraph of Article 70(1);

5 In a particular case, the finding, exercise or defence of legal rights in relation to my purposes.

In the cases mentioned in the 4 and 5 of this Article, the person responsible for processing personal data shall not transfer such data if he considers that the freedom and fundamental rights of the person concerned prevail over the public interest in the transfer envisaged.

Where a transfer is carried out for the purpose of safeguarding the interests of the person concerned, the controller shall keep a record of the date and time of the transfer, of the information on the competent authority to which it is addressed, of the justification for the transfer and of the personal characteristics transferred.

Any competent public authority mentioned in the first subparagraph of Article 70(1) may, in certain special cases, transfer personal data directly from recipients established in a State not belonging to the European Union where the other provisions of the present law applicable to the treatment covered by Article 70(1) are complied with and the following conditions are met:

1 The transfer is necessary for the execution of the mission of the competent authority which transmits these data for one of the finalit es nonc es in the first subparagraph of Article 70(1);

2 The competent authority which transcribes these data establishes that there is no freedom or fundamental rights of the person concerned which apply to the public interest making it necessary to transfer in the case in question;

3 The competent authority which transmits these data considers that the transfer of the competent authority of the other State is ineffective or inappropriate, in particular because the transfer cannot be carried out in a timely manner;

4 The competent authority of the other State is informed in the best of terms, unless it is ineffective or inappropriate;

5 The competent authority which transmits these data shall inform the recipient of the finalit or finalit s for which the personal data transmitted must be processed exclusively by that recipient, provided that such processing is necessary.

The competent authority which transmits data shall inform the National Commission on Informatics and Freedom of Transfer in accordance with the conditions laid down in this Article.
